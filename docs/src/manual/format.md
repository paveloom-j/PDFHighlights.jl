# [CSV Format](@id CSVFormat)

The format of CSV files generated by the [`import_highlights`](@ref) and
[`initialize`](@ref) functions corresponds to the format used by
[Readwise](https://readwise.io/) for bulk import of CSV files.

## Requirements

The following are the requirements for a CSV file set by the service:
- One mandatory column: `Highlight`
- Five optional columns: `Title`, `Author`, `URL`, `Note`, `Location`
- Quotes escaping: `""`, not `\"`.

The following are the requirements for the CSV file set by this package:
- Five mandatory columns: `Highlight`, `Title`, `Author`, `Note`, `Location`
- Quotes escaping: `""`, not `\"`.

It means that the [`import_highlights`](@ref) function is programmed to retrieve all data
related to the highlights, and will check for all columns when passing a third-party CSV
file.
